Description: The 'libmagic' library provides functions to determine
    'MIME' type and other metadata from files through their "magic"
    attributes. This is useful when you do not wish to rely solely on
    the honesty of a user or the extension on a file name. It also
    incorporates other metadata from the mime-db database
    <https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db>.
